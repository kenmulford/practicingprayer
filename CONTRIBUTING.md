# Contributing to Practicing Prayer

Thanks for your interest. This is primarily a personal project, but bug reports, feature suggestions, and pull requests are welcome. There are no commitments on response time or scope — fork the project under [GPL-3.0](LICENSE.txt) if you need something I can't move on quickly.

## Filing an issue

Pick the template that fits — these prompt for the details I need to act:

| Template | When to use |
|---|---|
| **Bug report** | Something doesn't work right. Repro steps, device, OS version, app version are required. Screenshots are optional but helpful. |
| **Feature request** | A new capability or improvement. Describe the **problem** you're trying to solve, not just the proposed solution. |
| **Tech debt** | Refactors, test infrastructure, build tooling — internal-quality work. |
| **Needs design** | Idea where the **what** is clear but the **how** has open architectural questions. |

Personal questions and prayer stories are best handled privately by email at [practicingprayerapp@gmail.com](mailto:practicingprayerapp@gmail.com), not in a public issue.

### Privacy when attaching screenshots

If a screenshot shows personal prayer content, names, or notes, blur or crop those before posting. The bug-report template only asks for screenshots — diagnostic logs are not requested through the issue tracker. If a developer needs a log to diagnose your bug, they'll ask you to email it.

## Branch model

This project follows a Gitflow-style model. **`master` and `dev` are protected** — every change reaches them through a pull request that passes the `Unit Tests` CI check, and history is **squash-merged** (one commit per PR; the branch auto-deletes on merge).

| Branch | Branch from | PR into | For |
|---|---|---|---|
| `feature/*` | `dev` | `dev` | New behavior |
| `fix/*` | `dev` | `dev` | Bug fixes |
| `release/*` | `dev` | `master`, then `dev` | Release stabilization — maintainer only |
| `hotfix/*` | `master` | `master`, then `dev` | Urgent production fixes — maintainer only |

- `dev` is the integration branch; `master` reflects released (app-store) builds and is tagged per release. Release tags are the plain marketing version, e.g. `1.5.1` (set by `ApplicationDisplayVersion` in `Directory.Build.props`). The build number is auto-stamped into the binary from the commit count (`ApplicationVersion`) and is **not** part of the tag.
- Contributors work on `feature/*` or `fix/*` off `dev`. `release/*` and `hotfix/*` are maintainer-driven, and merge **twice** — into `master` (tagged) and back into `dev` so the fix carries forward.
- **When to cut a `release/*`:** only when `dev` needs to keep taking new work while a build is frozen for stabilization or App Store review. For a straightforward release with nothing queued behind it, `dev → master` directly is equivalent.

## Submitting a pull request

1. Fork the repo on GitHub.
2. Branch from `dev` — name it `feature/<short-desc>` or `fix/<short-desc>`.
3. Make your changes; keep commits focused and reviewable. One concern per branch.
4. Run the test suite locally — see [Build and run](README.md#build-and-run) and the test layout below.
5. Open the PR against `dev`. Link the issue with `Closes #<n>` if one exists. The `Unit Tests` check must pass before merge.

PRs are squash-merged into `dev`, so your in-branch commit history is for review readability — the final history is one squashed commit per PR.

### What to test before opening a PR

| Surface | Command |
|---|---|
| Unit tests | `dotnet test PrayerApp.Tests/PrayerApp.Tests.csproj` |
| Build | `dotnet build PrayerApp/PrayerApp.csproj` for both `net10.0-android` and `net10.0-ios` (iOS requires macOS + Xcode) |
| UI tests | `PrayerApp.UITests/` — Appium-based, requires emulator/sim and `appium` running locally. Optional for small PRs; required for changes touching navigation, list virtualization, or share/import flows. |

### Code review expectations

- Architecture and naming conventions are documented in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md). Read the section relevant to your change before writing.
- New behavior should land with tests. Pure refactors with existing green coverage are fine.
- Don't bundle unrelated changes into one PR. If you find unrelated cleanups while working, file a separate `tech-debt` issue for them.

## Labels

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `bug`, `enhancement`, `tech-debt` | Issue type. Auto-applied by templates. |
| `needs-design`, `needs-investigation` | Open scope decisions or unproven hypothesis — implementation shouldn't start from this state without further discussion. |
| `needs-repro`, `cannot-reproduce` | Bug witnessed but not reproduced in-house. Eyewitness reports help. |
| `accessibility`, `privacy`, `performance`, `infra` | Topic area. |
| `regression-net`, `false-green-risk`, `test-infrastructure` | Test-quality signal. |
| `ios`, `android`, `tablet` | Platform scope. |
| `good first issue` | Smaller scope, suitable for a first PR. |
| `closed-retroactively` | Created post-fix for `git log` archaeology only. Already closed. |
