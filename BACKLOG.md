## Priority Queue

Items are listed in work order. Start at the top, work down.

| # | ID | Item | Source | Notes |
|---|-----|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | F-13 | iOS native form design pass — Phase 1 (field + container styling) | Ken | Remove nested border effect on iOS: transparent InputBorder + no-stroke PrayerCardBorder on iOS. Fix placeholder color (Gray200→Gray400). Android unchanged. Phase 2 (button layout) deferred. |
| 2 | M-4 | Loading indicators on list pages | Audit | PrayerCardsPage, PrayerListPage, TagsPage show blank screen during async load. Add `IsLoading` + `ActivityIndicator`. |
| 3 | M-7 | Accessibility on SwipeView actions | Audit | No `SemanticProperties` on swipe actions (Edit/Delete/Favorite). VoiceOver/TalkBack users can't discover them. |
| 4 | M-5 | Hardcoded SwipeItem colors in TagsPage | Audit | `LightSteelBlue` and `IndianRed` — should use `StaticResource Primary`/`DangerRed`. Won't match theme or dark mode. |
| 5 | M-10 | Custom colors no dark mode adjustment | Audit | Non-palette colors use raw hex in both themes. Dark colors invisible on dark bg. Need brightness adjustment. |
| 6 | M-1 | OnboardingBanner StepChanged event leak | Audit | Can double-subscribe on re-parent. Unsubscribe before subscribing. |
| 7 | M-2 | AppShell StepChanged lambda no try/catch | Audit | Fire-and-forget async lambda — if `ShowPopupAsync` throws, exception is unobserved. |
| 8 | M-3 | TagsPage full reload every OnAppearing | Audit | No `_loaded` guard like other tabs. Causes flicker. Add `RefreshAsync()` pattern. |
| 9 | M-6 | Hardcoded `TextColor="White"` in XAML | Audit | MainPage, PrayerTimePage — should use `{StaticResource White}` for consistency. |
| 10 | F-15 | Notification tap opens prayer request + ad hoc "I prayed" button | Ken | Currently notification opens to home page with no context. Should deep-link to the prayer request view page. Add standalone "I prayed for this" button so users can record interactions outside Prayer Time. |
| 11 | F-16 | Manage user color palette — delete/reorder swatches | — | `DeleteColorAsync` exists in `IUserColorService` but has no UI. Spec out full UX before implementing. |
| 12 | L-1/2 | Dead NavigatedTo handlers | Audit | Empty `ContentPage_NavigatedTo` in PrayerCardsPage + no-op SelectedItem=null in PrayerListPage. Remove. |
| 13 | L-7 | Remove unused location privacy strings from Info.plist | Audit | `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` etc. — app doesn't use location. May confuse Apple reviewers. |
| 14 | TD-12 | Full ViewModel ObservableCollection audit | — | Review all ObservableCollections across all ViewModels for blocking calls, inconsistencies, and data flow issues. |
| 15 | TD-8 | Refactor ViewModels to constructor injection | — | All ViewModels resolve services at runtime via MAUI DI host, making them impossible to unit test. |
| 16 | F-10 | Deep-link share — create card/request via tapped link | — | Deferred until app is in the store — full plan at `docs/plans/F10-deep-link-share.md` |
| 17 | INV-4 | In-app update notification — Android Play Core | — | **Blocked:** `Xamarin.Google.Android.Play.App.Update 2.1.0.18` conflicts with MAUI 10.0.41 AndroidX pin. Resume when MAUI bumps AndroidX floor or a compatible binding ships. |
| 18 | UX-12 | Replace emoji glyphs with SVG icons | Ken | Emoji glyphs don't render on iOS (OpenSans lacks emoji, system fallback fails). Removed for now. Locations that need SVG icons: `OnboardingWelcomePopup` (was 🙏), `OnboardingCompletePopup` (was ✨). |
| 19 | UX-11 | Page transition animations | Ken | Custom slide/swipe animations on Shell navigation. Requires platform-specific handlers (iOS + Android). Evaluate Lottie for loading animations when implementing M-4. |

## Detailed Descriptions

### F-15 Notification deep-link + ad hoc "I prayed" button

**Reporter:** Ken
**Details:** Two related changes:
1. When user taps a notification, navigate to the specific prayer request's view page instead of the home page.
2. Add an "I prayed for this" button on the prayer request view/detail page so users can log interactions without entering a full Prayer Time session.
**Requires:** Deep-link routing from notification payload → Shell navigation to PrayerDetailPage with prayer ID.

### F-16 Manage user color palette — delete/reorder swatches

**Reporter:** Internal (session 14)
**Details:** `IUserColorService.DeleteColorAsync(int id)` exists in the service layer but has no UI surface. Users can add custom colors via the "+" button but cannot remove them.
**To spec:**
- How should delete be triggered? Long-press on a swatch? Edit mode toggle?
- Should the 8 default palette colors be deletable, or only user-added ones?
- Confirm dialog before delete?
- Should there be a reorder capability?
- Tags store their color as a raw hex string (`PrayerTag.Color`). Deleting a `UserColor` row does NOT affect existing tags — they keep their color. The swatch just won't appear in the picker. Should we warn if a color is in use?

### TD-8 Refactor ViewModels to constructor injection

All ViewModels resolve services via `IPlatformApplication.Current!.Services.GetRequiredService<>()` inside the default constructor. This couples them to the MAUI runtime — they cannot be instantiated in a test context.

**Fix:** Add constructor overloads (or replace the default constructor) that accept injected services. Register ViewModels with DI in `MauiProgram.cs` and update XAML pages to resolve them from the container rather than using `<viewModels:XViewModel />` in XAML.

**Affects all ViewModels:** `PrayerRequestDetailViewModel`, `PrayerCardViewModel`, `HomeViewModel`, `PrayerTimeViewModel`, `TagDetailViewModel`, `SettingsViewModel`

**Unlocks:** Full ViewModel unit test coverage including notification scheduling hooks, mark-answered flow, onboarding state transitions

### F-10 Deep-link share

> **Full implementation plan:** [`docs/plans/F10-deep-link-share.md`](docs/plans/F10-deep-link-share.md)
> **Deferred until app is live in the App Store / Play Store** — the `prayercards://` URI scheme must be registered and live before links work for recipients.

Both cards and individual requests are shareable. Share sheet sends a `prayercards://` deep link alongside a plain-text fallback (for recipients without the app).

**Recipient behavior:**
- Shared card → auto-saved silently as a new card with all active requests
- Shared request → auto-saved into a "Shared with me" system card (top of list, cannot be deleted, hideable in Settings)

| — | App renamed to "Practicing Prayer" | — | ApplicationTitle, BackupService filename, NotificationService title, AppShell, Info.plist, website, onboarding popup all updated |
| — | iOS TestFlight — build 1.0.4 (build 7) | — | Provisioning profile "Practicing Prayer" (App Store Distribution), Entitlements.plist added, xcode-select fixed, submitted via Transporter |
| BUG-17 | Prayer request title pre-populated on new form | — | `Prayer.cs` default changed from "Prayer Request" to `string.Empty`; auto-focus added to TitleEntry on new request |
| BUG-19 | iOS Info.plist missing NSLocation* purpose strings | — | Keys already present from prior session; no code change needed |
| BUG-20 | Home screen containers low contrast in dark mode | — | Two `{StaticResource Tertiary}` labels in MainPage.xaml switched to `AppThemeBinding` (Tertiary light / White dark) |
| BUG-18 | Prayer Time timer visible on "all done" end state | — | Added `IsVisible` InverseBool binding to Row 0 header Grid in PrayerTimePage.xaml |
| BUG-21 | Tag data model — tags stored at card level instead of request level | — | Added `PrayerRequestId` column to `PrayerCardTag`; new request-level service methods; data migration on startup; `PrayerRequestDetailViewModel` and `PrayerTimeViewModel` updated |
| F-12 | Prayer list page UX overhaul | — | Live search (title + card name + tag name), 3-way status toggle (Active/Answered/All), tag chip filter; `PrayerListViewModel` full rewrite; 55 tests passing |
| BUG-22 | iOS AOT crash on launch (build 8) — SQLite-net module out of date | — | `Platforms/iOS/LinkerConfig.xml` with `preserve="all"` for SQLite-net + SQLitePCLRaw; wired via `TrimmerRootDescriptor` in csproj. |
| BUG-23 | Prayers tab crash — `XamlParseException: StaticResource not found for key Gray700` | — | 3 references to undefined `Gray700` replaced with `Gray600` in PrayerListPage.xaml toggle buttons. |
| TD-9 | Dark mode color audit | — | Full audit. 2 confirmed failures, 1 borderline. Fixes tracked as TD-11. Notes at `docs/research/TD-9-dark-mode-color-audit.md`. |
| TD-7 | Extract `ILocalNotificationCenter` | — | `ILocalNotificationCenter` + `NotifyRepeat` enum; `LocalNotificationCenterWrapper`; `NotificationService` fully injectable. 11 new tests; 66/66 passing. |
| TD-11 | Dark-mode contrast fixes (from TD-9 audit) | — | Primary → AppThemeBinding on PrayerCardsPage + Settings; SuccessGreen → AppThemeBinding on PrayerDetailPage. Added `SuccessGreenDark` to Colors.xaml. |
| UX-4 | Delete confirmation dialogs | — | Confirmation on card delete (with prayer count), prayer delete (with title), tag delete (already had it). All entry points covered. |
| BUG-25 | Prayer edit shows wrong notification toggle + frequency | — | `RefreshProperties()` never notified `PrayerFrequency` (only `PrayerFrequencyDisplay`). Picker stayed at model default (`Weekly`). Added `OnPropertyChanged(nameof(PrayerFrequency))` to setter and `RefreshProperties()`. |
| BUG-24 | Tag filter doesn't refresh after saving prayer via card | — | `_requestTagIds` lookup in `PrayerListViewModel` was only built in constructor, never rebuilt on save. Extracted `HandleSavedAsync` that rebuilds tag lookup + refreshes tag chips. |
| UX-9 | InputBorder — bordered container for all input fields | — | Added `InputBorder` named style (White/Gray900 bg, Gray300/Gray600 stroke, 8px corners). Wrapped 8 inputs across 4 edit pages. Editor implicit bg changed to Transparent. TagDetailPage label standardized to FormLabel. |
| UX-6 | Uniform action buttons across all data entry forms | — | PrayerCardPage Delete now uses `DangerButton` (was unstyled `StyleClass=""`). QuickAddPage Cancel uses `GhostButton`. All button grids standardized to `ColumnSpacing="8"` + `HorizontalOptions="Fill"`. |
| UX-5 | Tag entry UX — section header + spacing | — | Tags section already had FormLabel header. Added DividerLine separator with top margin between tag area and action buttons on PrayerDetailPage. |
| BUG-26 | Typed tag without hitting Return doesn't save | — | `SaveAsync` now auto-submits any pending `TagSearchText` before saving via `SubmitTagEntryAsync()`. |
| UX-8 | Remove underline from prayer requests on home + prayers pages | — | Removed per-request DividerLine BoxView from MainPage.xaml and PrayerListPage.xaml item templates. |
| TD-10 | Fix XC0022/XC0023 compiled binding warnings | — | Replaced `x:DataType="{x:Null}"` with `x:DataType="models:PrayerTag"` in PrayerDetailPage.xaml SuggestedTags DataTemplate. QuickAddPage already fully typed. |
| BUG-27 | Splash screen shows broken image instead of app icon | — | Replaced placeholder `splash.svg` (yellow line on card) with app icon foreground SVG. `MauiSplashScreen Color` provides the green background. |
| BUG-28 | iOS 26 crash on launch during tab transition | — | Removed blocking `.Result` calls from PrayerCardsViewModel and PrayerListViewModel constructors (deadlock risk on iOS 26 scheduler). Added async `LoadAsync()` called from `OnAppearing`. Added global exception handlers to iOS AppDelegate for diagnostics. Guarded onboarding popup with try/catch. |
| BUG-29 | iPad crash when skipping onboarding tour | — | `PopupBlockedException` — popup must be closed before mutating onboarding state so modal stack is clear when completion popup fires. Reordered `CloseAsync` before `Skip()`/`Advance()`. |
| BUG-30 | Switch "On" state invisible in dark mode | — | `OnColor` dark value was `Gray200` (near-white) with white thumb. Changed to `Primary` (green) so white thumb is clearly visible in dark mode. |
| UX-7 | Home page unified overdue card + Last Prayed stat | — | Merged two disconnected boxes into one `PrayerCardBorder` card: bold count header (tappable → Prayers filtered to Overdue) + inline needs-attention list. Added "Last prayed: X" stat label. Added `FilterStatus.Overdue` to PrayerListViewModel + `?filter=overdue` navigation. |
| UX-10 | Prayer card form styling — match request form | — | Applied `PrayerCardBorder` style, removed redundant "Prayer Card" title label, restructured to Grid layout with pinned onboarding banner, added DividerLine above buttons. |
| F-14 | Tag color palette: user-defined colors + native picker | — | New `UserColor` model + `IUserColorService` (CRUD + seed 8 defaults). iOS: native `UIColorPickerViewController`. Android: visual HSV color picker popup (saturation/value 2D area + hue slider + hex display). TagDetailPage swatches in FlexLayout wrap grid with "+" button. Decoupled `UserColorService` from MAUI for testability. 11 new unit tests (77/77 total). Tag deletion does not cascade to UserColors. |
| H-1 | Fire-and-forget async error handling | — | `IDiagnosticLog` + `DiagnosticLog` singleton (append-only file, 100-entry trim). `TaskExtensions.SafeFireAndForget()` extension. All 19 `_ = X()` sites replaced. "Send Diagnostic Info" button in Settings (OS share sheet). 9 new tests (86/86 total). |
| H-2 | iOS AppDelegate missing `e.SetObserved()` | — | Added `e.SetObserved()`. Handler code extracted to `MauiProgram.RegisterGlobalExceptionHandlers()` (shared iOS/Android). Switched from `Preferences.Set("LastCrash")` to `IDiagnosticLog` with console fallback. |
| H-3 | PrayerCardViewModel.Reload() race condition | — | Removed redundant synchronous `RefreshProperties()` from `Reload()` and `ApplyQueryAttributes`. `LoadPrayerCardAsync` `finally` block is the single notification point. |
| H-4 | Null checks on `LoadAsync` return values | — | 6 call sites guarded. Page-load methods navigate back on null; in-list operations return silently. `PrayerRequestDetailViewModel.LoadPrayerAsync` restructured to avoid `finally` on null. |
| H-6 | PrayerTag.Color MaxLength(7) too short | — | `MaxLength(7)` → `MaxLength(9)` to support `#AARRGGBB`. No DB migration needed. |
| H-5 | PrayerInteraction table unbounded growth | — | `GetOverduePrayersAsync` and `GetLastInteractionDateAsync` rewritten to use SQL GROUP BY / MAX queries via `GetLatestInteractionByPrayerAsync` and `GetMaxInteractionDateAsync`. No longer loads all rows into memory. |
| M-8 | Card delete orphans PrayerCardTag junction rows | — | `DeleteJunctionRowsByRequestIdAsync` added to IDBService/DBService. Called in `PrayerService.DeletePrayerAsync` cascade. |
| M-9 | Prayer delete orphans PrayerInteraction rows | — | `DeleteInteractionsByPrayerIdAsync` added to IDBService/DBService. Called in `PrayerService.DeletePrayerAsync` cascade. One-time orphan cleanup migration in `DBService.UpdateSchema()`. |
| L-4 | Remove deprecated card-level ITagService methods | — | 4 `[Obsolete]` card-level methods removed from `ITagService`, `TagService`, `IDBService`, `DBService`, `PrayerCardTag`. Associated tests removed. |
